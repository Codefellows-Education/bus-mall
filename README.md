# bus-mall
This is an app designed to collect data from a focus group about different products so that the company knows which ones to invest in. It displays three unique images at a time without repeating any of the images on the previous screen. Users vote by clicking on the one they would be most interested in purchasing. After 25 votes, the results are displayed in a graph using chart.js and the users data is stored to local storage so that if they go through the voting process again, their data will be added on to their previous sessions.

## collaborators
I would like to thank John and Amanda, Hannah and Kat for all their help. My husband, Adam, helped me refactor my code and Ray was my partner for pair programing while we tried to add a shopping cart to the app.
